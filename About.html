                    <h5>Our Story</h5>
                    <p>As a child growing up in Nigeria I didn’t have resources to learn about computers and how they operate. The first time I learned about computers and how to use them in college. By that time most of the students in my class were already have knowledge of computers. I decided that I will help any student who is wanting to learn about computers but doesn’t have resources to pay for expensive classes by providing free courses, to give those kids a chance to learn.<br><br> 

                        I created this website to give people an opportunity to learn basic computer skills, who otherwise would not have a chance. We offer completely FREE class for all those who want to learn. There are 3 courses that you should complete to finish the this program.<br><br>
                         If you have a desire to continue and want to learn more advanced skills, please, visit out "Registration" page where you can see what we have available and request more information. <br><br>
After taking these courses you will be able to have basic understanding of computer hardware, software and system applications which will give you a greater chance in accomplishing what you want. Hopefully you will love STEM and want to pursue it further. </p>

                        <li>Elena from Ukraine said, "This has helped my child learn more about basic computer skills and the best part it was free for my child to use. He has learned so much and it was very user friendly"</li>
                        <li>LeAnn from USA said, "This is amazing! My Tommy has always wanted to learn more aobut computers but as working more i dont really have time to teach him, so it was great when my friend told me about this website that could teach my child all the basics he needed to know. Now he wants to sign up for the advanced class"</li>
                        <li>Thelma from Nigeria, "I didnt grow up around computers and to be honest i never really had desire to learn because i didnt really see the need for it. Now with industry moving fast with technology i felt like i really needed to learn just how to type so i could apply for better jobs! I was able to learn how to type in couple of weeks and then it just took practice and from practice now i can type without even looking at the keyboard"</li>
                        <li>Justina from Nigeria, "I work at school as a Principal and we dont have a lot of resources to teach our children about technology, but we really wanted to especially with all the good jobs now require some kind of computer knowledge. We only have 6 computers at our schools, so we had to separate students and have them work in groups on watching videos and do practices on this wonderful website. Thank you very much, "It is all about basics", you have helped us greatly" </li>
